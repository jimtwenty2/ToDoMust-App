### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed ([flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev))
- Dart SDK installed (usually comes with Flutter)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   > git clone https://github.com/jimtwenty2/ToDoMust-App.git

   > cd ToDoMustApp

   > flutter pub get

   > flutter run
   ```

About the JSON Server ( https://github.com/typicode/json-server/tree/v0 )
The app uses a local JSON server to simulate API calls, allowing offline testing and easier backend integration without a real remote server. This helps with development and testing CRUD operations locally.

### Important ‚ö†Ô∏è :

- Be sure to set your local IP address in ApiService (e.g., http://192.168.x.x:3000) so your app can connect to the server.
- Place your db.json inside lib/services/db_api/ or another accessible directory.
- To Start the JSON Server: 
   ```bash

   > json-server --watch db.json --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000

   ```

### Upload Image
Image Picker Integration
Users can upload profile and cover images using the device‚Äôs camera or gallery via the Flutter Image Picker package, integrated with GetX for smooth state management.

### Calendar
Custom Calendar
A fully custom calendar widget is built from scratch to display and select dates within the app, giving you flexibility to customize UI and interactions beyond built-in calendar widgets.
