# ToDoMust-App
A simple Flutter Todo app using GetX for state management, routing, and bindings. Supports localization, theme switching, and API calls with GetConnect and a local JSON server. Data and settings persist with GetStorage—so no data is lost when the app closes. I’m new to Flutter &amp; GitHub—feedback and suggestions are very welcome!
